                The Picks Team is opening Fox’s Pizza Den locations in the
                greater Denver and Colorado Springs Market. We are excited to
                help grow and develop the brand in the area! Like the original
                Fox’s location in Pittsburgh, PA the Picks Team is fulfilling a
                lifelong dream. Our dream is to care deeply for our community,
                impact our guests and team and become a tradition in our small
                town.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The Fox’s Pizza Den history started with $500, a rented
                storeroom and a few pieces of used equipment rescued from the
                snow and ice of a Pittsburgh scrap yard where Jim Fox fulfilled
                his lifelong dream of opening a pizza shop in his hometown of
                Pitcairn, Pennsylvania.

            <p>
              As the first pizza slid from the oven at 4:00 that afternoon, he
              had no way of knowing that he’d be sold out just six hours later,
              making Fox’s Pizza Den an instant success. Decades later, we’re
              still an institution in hometowns all over America. We are excited
              to bring this east coast pizza to Colorado and we hope you join us
              as we move from 200 to 300 locations nationwide!
